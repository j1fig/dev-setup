# If we want to have bash immediately add commands to our history 
# instead of waiting for the end of each session (to enable commands 
# in one terminal to be instantly be available in another), we can also 
# set or append the history -a command to the PROMPT_COMMAND parameter, 
# which contains commands that are executed before each new command prompt.
# To do this correctly, we need to do a bit of a hack. We need to append 
# to the history file immediately with history -a, clear the current 
# history in our session with history -c, and then read the history file 
# that we've appended to, back into our session history with history -r.
# You can do this like so:

export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
